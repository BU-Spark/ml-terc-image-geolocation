# Project Description

The Windows on Earth program receives astronaut photos from the International Space Station (ISS). We know the location of the ISS when the photo was taken, but not what the photo is of. The subject is generally in a 300 mile radius of ISS location. 

This project seeks to use image recognition/machine learning combined with a virtual world simulator (we use Cesium) to attempt to geolocate the images automatically. We have a website at [Windows on Earth](https://www.windowsonearth.org/). 

Our goal is to accurately "predict" the location of the image. Specifically, we need the ability to recognize what the image is of, based on a simulated view of the world using things such as coastal or lake outlines, rivers, and other features. The system would need to "look around" in the simulation trying to match the photo to likely subjects (again, usually within 300 miles radius).
